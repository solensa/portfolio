        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Change management in the 20,000 people strong Group IT division of Lloyds Banking Group used to rely on a A2 PDF of swimlanes with 100’s of events and communications points sprawled across it. This was manually updated fortnightly by a team of four who would ask the various business and IT functions for their upcoming changes. It wasn’t a system that worked particularly well, with failure to spot a clash in two or more change events being frequent. Upon taking the role of Group IT Change Management Lead I set sights on improving the tooling.</p>

        <h4>The Design</h4>
        <p>It was clear that a change management tool must be able to take a lot of information and make it digestible. To this degree it was sensible to adopt a tag and filter mechanism to allow users to generate the data view they wish to see.
        Taking inspiration from a variety of Mieruka (見える化) visualisations I’d seen, I shaped the change events to stack by month in a form similar to a Kanban (看板) board extending vertically to encourage virtual scrolling - more natural to desktop and mobile device users.
        Another key change I sought was to crowdsource information rather than having only a select few populate the tool - a clear bottleneck.
        It went without saying that the tool should be real-time and dynamic.
        The resulting mockup and pitch I gave got a big thumbs up from stakeholders including the Group CIO and his direct reports.

        <h4>The Build</h4>
        <p>The build was pretty straight forward using HTML, CSS and AngularJS in the front end. The UI design I lifted from Acrolist, and Orgtree to give consistency across my own tool portfolio. Finally the back end was a Sharepoint which allowed users to add, amend and delete data, create groups with permissions, and track who was doing what.
        To analyse the nature of changes going out, I added a metrics page using Google Charts, which in parallel with Google Analytics allowed one to see what we were supplying, and what there was demand for.

        <h4>Contentions</h4>
        <p>Upon completion there were a few calls for there to be a user guide, something I objected. A personal belief is that if a tool which is to be used by the masses is not intuitive enough to use without a guide, it’s a bad tool.
        It became apparent that some senior directors were more comfortable with a swimlane chart. To this effect I added a new view which allowed one to dynamically create their own swimlane chart using the relevant filters.

        <h4>The Result</h4>
        <p>Masterplan cut the need for a four person team (allowing them to move onto more productive tasks) and was formally adopted by Group IT as the change management centerpiece. It is now used for Air Traffic Control and communications in Group Transformation.
        The number of filters allowed for over 7,000,000 unique views of the data which could be saved by bookmarking the URL generated.
